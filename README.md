# Prospector's Journal

Based on the seminal TCNodeTracker by Dyonovan, this tool will track [GregTech6](https://github.com/GregTech6/gregtech6) ore-bearing rocks so you don't have to super-clutter your waypoint manager in order to find ore veins again. Additional feautres for discovered ore blocks in the vein, and bedrock veins with their indicator flowers. Configurable to also track many of the different stone layer types, and [Immersive Engineering](https://github.com/BluSunrize/ImmersiveEngineering) excavator veins - since they didn't add the core sample item until modern versions.

This is intended to be used diagetically through the epynomous Prospector's Journal item, but defaults to working all the time via keybind much like TCNT.

There are also a set of bags and boxes to carry the sample rocks in, for inventory QoL while out exploring. They can pick up rocks with Fortune by default.

Much credit also goes to Max Musterman (OvermindDL1) for his superb pre-built workspace for GT6 extension mods.
