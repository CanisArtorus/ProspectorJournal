Based on the seminal TCNodeTracker by Dyonovan, this tool will track GT6 ore-bearing rocks so you don't have to super-clutter your waypoint manager in order to find ore veins again.

This is intended to be used diagetically through the epynomous Prospector's Journal item, but defaults to working all the time via keybind much like TCNT.

Please excuse the mess, my only previous attempt at modding minecraft didn't get off the drawing board.

Much credit goes to Max Musterman (OvermindDL1) for his superb pre-built workspace for GT6 extension mods.
